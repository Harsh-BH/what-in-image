## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end image caption generator that combines the power of deep learning (CNNs and LSTMs/Transformers) with traditional machine learning (boosting models like XGBoost) for attribute prediction and model ensemble. The system extracts visual features from images, predicts high-level attributes using a boosting classifier, and generates captions using a sequence model. Optionally, an ensemble of captioning models is weighted using boosting principles for improved results.

## Key Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained CNNs (ResNet, VGG16, etc.) to extract visual features.
- **Attribute Prediction**: Integrates boosting models (XGBoost, AdaBoost) for predicting image attributes.
- **Caption Generation**: Generates descriptive captions using LSTM or Transformer models, optionally with attention mechanisms.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines outputs of multiple models using boosting-based weighting for improved caption quality.
- **Customizable Pipeline**: Easily extendable for different datasets and model architectures.

## Architecture

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Extract image features using a pre-trained CNN.
2. **Attribute Prediction**: Use a boosting model to predict image attributes from the CNN features.
3. **Caption Generation**: Feed both the CNN features and predicted attributes into an LSTM or Transformer for caption generation.
4. **Ensemble/Weighting**: Train multiple captioning models and use boosting principles to weight their outputs for the final caption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- XGBoost or scikit-learn (for boosting models)
- OpenCV or PIL for image processing
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for tutorials)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-caption-boosting.git
   cd image-caption-boosting
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place your dataset in the `data/` directory. See [Dataset](#dataset) for details.
2. **Train Attribute Classifier**:
   ```
   python train_attribute_classifier.py
   ```
3. **Train Captioning Model**:
   ```
   python train_caption_generator.py
   ```
4. **Generate Captions**:
   ```
   python generate_captions.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
5. **(Optional) Ensemble Training**:
   ```
   python ensemble_training.py
   ```

## Dataset

This project uses the [Flickr8k](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) or [MS COCO](https://cocodataset.org/) dataset. Place the images in `data/images/` and the captions in `data/captions/`. For attribute prediction, you may need to label images with attributes or use existing attribute datasets.

## Results

- **Sample Captions**: See `results/sample_captions.md` for examples of generated captions.
- **Performance Metrics**: BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores are provided in `results/metrics.md`.
